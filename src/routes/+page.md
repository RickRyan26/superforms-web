<Header />

Superforms is a SvelteKit library that helps you with **server-side validation** and **client-side display** of forms.

It enables you to use a Zod validation schema as a **single source of truth**, with consistent handling of form data and validation errors.

The API is minimal, basically a single method on the server and client, but is very flexible and configurable to handle every possible case of:

- Nested data structures
- Multiple forms on the same page
- Tainted fields
- Client-side validation
- And much more.
