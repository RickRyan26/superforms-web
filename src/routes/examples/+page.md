<Head title="Form examples" />

If you have gone through the Concepts section of this site, maybe you want to test out some things or see some working examples. There are plenty of Stackblitz projects that you can take a look at.

## Playground and bug reporting

For experimenting, bug reporting, or more advanced support questions.

- [Valibot](https://stackblitz.com/edit/superforms-2-testing-valibot?file=src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.server.ts,src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.svelte)
- [Zod](https://stackblitz.com/edit/superforms-2-testing?file=src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.server.ts,src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.svelte)

## Multi-step forms

A multi-step form does not have to be complicated. Here are two examples:

- The pleasant [client-side experience](https://stackblitz.com/edit/superforms-2-multi-step-form-client?file=src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.server.ts,src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.svelte)
- For the purists, a multi-step form that [works without JavaScript](https://stackblitz.com/edit/superforms-2-multi-step-form-server?file=src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.server.ts,src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.svelte)! 

## Other examples

There is a whole collection of examples on Stackblitz, how to use select/drop menus, grouped radio buttons, checkboxes, etc. Check it out here:

The examples will be migrated to version 2 and added here gradually. Send a message on Discord if you have an idea of something else that should be included!
