# Roadmap to 1.0

<svelte:head><title>Superforms roadmap</title></svelte:head>

We are very close to a v1.0 release with the v0.8 update, the last milestone before 1.0 which brings [realtime client-side validation](/concepts/client-validation).

There will be a period of bug fixes, then we're ready for official release!
