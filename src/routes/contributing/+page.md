# Contributing

Contributions to Superforms are very welcome! The issues and discussion pages on Github are always open for comments, and if you want to contribute some code, it's quite easy. Just fork either the [Superforms](https://github.com/ciscoheat/sveltekit-superforms) repository or its [website](https://github.com/ciscoheat/superforms-web), then you just need to execute the following to be up and running:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

If you find a typo on the website, you can make a quick PR directly in its [Github repository](https://github.com/ciscoheat/superforms-web/tree/main/src/routes).

## Sponsoring

I'm doing my very best to provide super support on [Discord](https://discord.gg/AptebvVuhB) and [Github](https://github.com/ciscoheat/sveltekit-superforms) to everyone who needs help, and also to keep improving the library and this website. If you want to contribute a small sum towards that, it's greatly appreciated, knowing that someone wants to see this project improve and live on.

## Voting on new features

You can give a thumbs up on the [Github issues](https://github.com/ciscoheat/sveltekit-superforms/issues) marked with "enhancement", and I will prioritize the most popular ones for the next feature release.
