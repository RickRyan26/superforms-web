# Help & Support

There are two ways of getting support with using Superforms:

## Free support

If you're using Superforms in a personal or non-profit project, support is completely free; a star on [Github](https://github.com/ciscoheat/sveltekit-superforms) is more than enough if you want to contribute. Join #free-support on Discord and ask away!

## Commercial support

If you're making or aiming to make money on your project, a donation proportional to the current profit of the project or the company you work for, will give you a month of commercial support. Donate with one of the options below, then ask in the #commercial-support channel on Discord.

<Sponsor />

For a longer period, you can make a monthly donation. Any $10 or higher monthly donation will be listed on the [Sponsors](/sponsors) page with a picture and link, and in Discord as a Sponsor. Many thanks if you want to support open source software in this way!
