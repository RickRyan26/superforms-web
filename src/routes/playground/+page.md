# Superforms playground

<Head title="Superforms playground" />

If you have gone through the Concepts section of this site, maybe you want to test out some things. The easiest way to do that is to use the Stackblitz repos prepared for each validation library:

- [Valibot](https://stackblitz.com/edit/superforms-2-testing-valibot?file=src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.server.ts,src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.svelte)
- [Zod](https://stackblitz.com/edit/superforms-2-testing?file=src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.server.ts,src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.svelte)

They'll give you a starting point that you can use for experimenting, bug reporting, or more advanced support questions.

## Other examples

There is a whole collection of examples on Stackblitz, how to use select/drop menus, grouped radio buttons, checkboxes, etc. Check it out here:

Send a message on Discord if you have an idea of an example that should be included!
