# Superforms playground

<Head title="Superforms playground" />

If you have gone through the Concepts section of this site, maybe you want to test out some things. The easiest way to do that is to use this Stackblitz repo:

[https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltekit-superforms-1-testing](https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltekit-superforms-1-testing?file=src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.server.ts,src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.svelte)

It gives you a starting point that you can use for experimenting, bug reporting, or more advanced support questions.

## Other examples

There is a whole collection of examples on Stackblitz, how to use grouped radio buttons, checkboxes, etc. Check it out here:

Send a message on Discord or post a discussion on Github if you have an idea of an example that should be included!
